# Example: Shared interfaces (role assignments, diagnostics, locks)

This example exercises the AVM shared interfaces supported by this module:

- Role assignments at the virtual network level
- Role assignments at the subnet level
- Diagnostic settings at the virtual network level
- A management lock at the virtual network level
