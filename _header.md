# Azure Virtual Network Module

This module is used to manage Azure Virtual Networks, Subnets and Peerings.

This module is composite and includes sub modules that can be used independently for pre-existing virtual networks. These sub modules are:

- subnet - The subnet module is used to manage subnets within a virtual network.
- peering - The peering module is used to manage virtual network peerings.

## Features

This module supports managing virtual networks and their associated subnets and peerings together or independently.

The module supports:

- Creating a new virtual network
- Creating a new subnet
- Creating a new virtual network peering
- Associating DNS servers with a virtual network
- Associating a DDOS protection plan with a virtual network
- Associating a network security group with a subnet
- Associating a route table with a subnet
- Associating a service endpoint with a subnet
- Associating a virtual network gateway with a subnet
- Assigning delegations to subnets

## Usage

To use this module in your Terraform configuration, you'll need to provide values for the required variables.

### Example - Virtual Network with Subnets

This example shows the most basic usage of the module. It creates a new virtual network with subnets.

```terraform
module "avm-res-network-virtualnetwork" {
  source = "Azure/avm-res-network-virtualnetwork/azurerm"

  address_space = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  location      = "eastus2"
  name          = "vnet-demo-eastus2-001"
  parent_id     = "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/rg-demo-eastus2-001"
  subnets = {
    "subnet1" = {
      name             = "subnet1"
      address_prefixes = ["10.0.0.0/24"]
    }
    "subnet2" = {
      name             = "subnet2"
      address_prefixes = ["10.0.1.0/24"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Example - Create a subnets on a pre-existing Virtual Network

This example shows how to create a subnet for a pre-existing virtual network using the subnet module.

```terraform
module "avm-res-network-subnet" {
  source = "Azure/avm-res-network-virtualnetwork/azurerm//modules/subnet"

  virtual_network = {
    resource_id = "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/myVNet"
  }
  name             = "subnet1"
  address_prefixes = ["10.0.0.0/24"]
}
```
